Sometimes people have unfinished basements that we can fish wires through. We usually aren't so lucky and have to crawl through attic space to fish wires through the walls. Please allow us atleast 3 hours before you can start watching anything.</td>

It is perfectly safe as long as you get your installtion done professionally; by someone that knows what they are doing. Fire places can be a tricky thing. The newer fire places are usually all "fake" and you have to turn the knob to light the fire place. Not like the old days where you go fetch some wood and burn a file. But than again, you were getting tv by an antenna in those days. Call us and we can talk more about this! =)</td>
