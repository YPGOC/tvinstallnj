<h2 class="lt-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <h5>How long does the installation normally take?</h5>
  <p class="hiw-text">-The time of the installation usually depends on what type of installation you are having done and what kind of wall that you have. Sometimes people have unfinished basements that we can fish wires through. We usually aren't so lucky and have to crawl through attic space to fish wires through the walls. Please allow us atleast 3 hours before you can start watching anything.</p>

  <h5>Is it safe to mount a large screen plasma TV or LCD Screen on top of the fire place?</h5>
  <p class="hiw-text">-This is usually a very common question. The answer to this question is YES! It is perfectly safe as long as you get your installtion done professionally; by someone that knows what they are doing. Fire places can be a tricky thing. The newer fire places are usually all "fake" and you have to turn the knob to light the fire place. Not like the old days where you go fetch some wood and burn a file.
